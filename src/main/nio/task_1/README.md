Description
NOTE: Don't forget using try-with-resources for all home tasks.

Task 1 - Serialization

Cost: 10 points.

Add the ability to serialize / deserialize for the hierarchy of objects from another homework. 
However, all numerical fields should not be serialized. 
Provide a test code in which you create several instances of various classes of this hierarchy 
and successfully complete the serialization/deserialization operation.

Penalties

* -5 points for the missed subtask;
* -5 points if table populating algorithm is trivial and ugly (using simple counters without the fantasy flight);
* -3 points if mentee doesn't use try-with-resources if it's possible;
* -2 points if connection parameters are not stored in property file;
* -5 points for each task if mentee ignores Java Code Conventions.
